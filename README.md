----------------------------------------------
## The steps to achieve these images are:
### 1. Load the content image
### 2. Load the style image
### 3. Randomly initialize the image to be generated
### 4. Load the VGG19 model
### 5. Compute the content cost
### 6. Compute the style cost
### 7. Compute the total cost
### 8. Define the optimizer and learning rate
